## Project Evolution & Drafts

### 1st_Draft
- **Basic Structure:** Initial version with core Python files for chatbot logic, data fetching, and sentiment analysis.
- **No Docker or Config:** Lacked containerization and centralized configuration, making deployment and management less flexible.
- **Web Interface:** Included a simple web interface for user interaction.

### 2nd_Draft & 3rd_Draft
- **Docker Integration:** Added Dockerfile for containerized deployment, improving portability and scalability.
- **Config File:** Introduced `config.py` for centralized settings management.
- **No Major Difference:** 3rd_Draft is essentially a copy of 2nd_Draft.

### 4th_Draft
- **Database Integration:** Added `fintalk.sqlite3` and `storage.py` for persistent data storage.
- **Docker Compose:** Introduced `docker-compose.yml` for multi-service orchestration.
- **Expanded Features:** More modular code, improved deployment, and data management.

### 5th_Draft (Current)
- **AI Integration:** Added `ai_client.py` for advanced AI features (e.g., OpenAI integration).
- **Environment Management:** Uses `.env` for secure API key and configuration management.
- **Full Stack:** Combines all previous improvementsâ€”Docker, Docker Compose, persistent storage, modular code, and AI capabilities.
- **Production Ready:** Most advanced, maintainable, and scalable version.
